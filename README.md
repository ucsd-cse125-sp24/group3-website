# Group 3 Website

## Recommended Workflow

1. Use VSCode and download the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension
2. Make changes locally, and view how they look on your local live server.
3. Once things look good, make a PR and then merge with main and the github action will push it to the site.
