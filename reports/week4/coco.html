    <h1> Coco's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Finish all player models</li>
        <li>Started to design weapons/Accessories</li>
        <li>Get started to design the maze (texture)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I finished all 4 player models, haven’t gone through the details and textures, but all the parts for players are modeled and texture mapping should be quick (I will add more details to clothes if we have more time)</li>
        <li>Did some research on texture </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It took longer to model than I expected, and I try to make the models look really good & realistic in some way so I experimented with lots of different ways I have never tried before.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Editor's Note:</b> They look great!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2D sketch of texture for the maze</li>
        <li>
            Finish some of the weapons
        </li>
        <li>
            Finalize player models and test them with our graphics system and make changes if necessary & start skeleton mapping & animation
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learnt a lot about different ways to model, sometimes it’s more about imagination-> cylinders are good friends and they can be turned into lots of things</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Editor's Note:</b> <img height=100 src="./assets/cylinder_friend.png"></img>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I need to develop a better way of time management</li>
    </ul>
