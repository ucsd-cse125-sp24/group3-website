    <h1> Edward's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Research into audio libraries</li>
        <li>Refactor server to generate entity IDs from ObjectManager</li>
        <li>Discuss with Tyler, Gil, and Ted about the structure for various objects and start initial implementation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Was able to look into audio libraries! Discussed more in depth in the “What I learned” section below.</li>
        <li>Got to refactor the server to generate entity IDs using a function from the class ObjectManager made by Gil</li>
        <li>Was able to discuss with Tyler, Gil, and Ted to plan out some details about how we wanted to structure players, enemies, and creatures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One thing that was kind of annoying was that early in the week I was running into an issue where OpenGL could not render the cube. After some debugging with Anthony, it turns out for some reason on my machine (and my machine only) it ended up in an if-statement that resulted in a failure. That code has since been commented out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Get some kind of audio playing</li>
        <li>Finalize Enemy, Player, and Creature classes implementation</li>
        <li>Sync up with Ted, Gil, and Tyler to discuss continued development on the game state & playing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of my learnings this week came from understanding the opinions of various audio libraries. I looked into SDL, SFML, and FMOD, and ultimately decided to settle on SDL since it’s a pretty popular cross-platform library that doesn’t seem too bad to get setup with. I’ve already gotten it set up on my machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My overall individual morale is still pretty high! I enjoy the intellectual challenges that come with designing the game. Look forward to the upcoming weeks where we really ramp up to get a full MVP.</li>
    </ul>
