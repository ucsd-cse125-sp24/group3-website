  <h1> Anthony's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix issues with our cube being rendered and accept user input.</li>
    <li>Complete milestone 1 which is the merge of the graphics, networking and game state teams. The final product
      should be a cube being rendered which you can move with user input.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We managed to fix the bugs with our rendering and got the cube to render.</li>
    <li>Also, are now handling user input which can be used to move the cube.</li>
    <li>Successfully sat down with the team and got the merge for Milestone 1 completed. Now a client can press a key to
      move the cube and have the server tell it to render the new position of the cube. We even got to test this with
      multiple clients on the lab computers and had multiple clients rendering the updated position of the cube.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I spent a good chunk of time fixing our CI since it was breaking for the Windows runners. Additionally, I had to
      add opengl dependencies to the Linux runners which took a bit to figure out. I also moved our linting to cppcheck
      which doesn’t take as long to run as clang-tidy. </li>
    <li>We ended up completing the milestone earlier in the week than expected so I had some extra time where I started
      refactoring how we handle user input and creating a main menu and lobby UI. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a simple UI for the title screen and lobby to set the server IP and set keybinds.</li>
    <li>Start rendering a hallway of the maze and try to see if we can get the cube moving down the hallway integrated
      with the collision work that Ted has done.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learned a bit more about how the game state and networking works after the merge.</li>
    <li>Learned how compiling C++ projects on windows can be down when debugging the actions breaking.</li>
    <li>Learned a bit about how imGui works for setting up our UI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I’m feeling alright but a bit wary. I’m satisfied with our progress but I’m feeling a bit unsure on what to
      focus on now that the first milestone is complete. I’m sure this will go away once we discuss the team’s goals and
      priorities for the coming week.</li>
  </ul>
