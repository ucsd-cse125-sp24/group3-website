  <h1> Coco's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  My concrete goals for the week were to:
  <ul>
    <li>Get started on modeling and model two characters</li>
    <li>Have a basic design of the maze</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I did one human body model for male, did the hair and finished some details on the clothes. I am still refining
      the rest. I am kinda skeptical about if I should make this more detailed cause it currently has roughly 600k
      vertices already for one player model even without the background, and I am not sure if the basement computers can
      handle that especially when it comes to multiplayer real-time combat.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I struggled a lot with the clothes and it currently looks different than my sketch. I tried different tools and
      finally moved to nomad, and I spent lots of time searching how to make this certain type of clothes. I tried ways
      to model the hair too, if I should model them piece by piece or just a whole piece, and there are trade offs too.
      Piece by piece looks better but computationally expensive but I am currently going with piece by piece. I am also
      kinda cooked by the labs and midterms:(
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The first thing is to discuss our rendering capabilities.</li>
    <li>Then I will decide if I should further make the model more detailed or keep it like this, or if the computers
      are not that good I will move to more stylized models.</li>
    <li>I will have all the player models done by next week</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I understand computer graphics better in a more easily accessible way. In my CG class I only learnt about how to
      generate Beizer/B-Spline curves with clicks but now I know they can be used to model the hair. I learnt a lot
      about modeling, a lot of different ways to model clothes, techniques of shading.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I am (a bit) behind this week, and I feel kinda frustrated sitting for hours trying to make the model work out.
      Itâ€™s still not looking satisfying to me as I expected but I suddenly thought of some way to model the cloth before
      I slept yesterday so I will get started on that idea once I am done with the midterm.</li>
  </ul>
