    <h1> David's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
      My concrete goals were to:
      <ul>
        <li>Achieve milestone 1, which was to connect the client and server together for baseline interaction</li>
        <li>Refactor client code & graphics rendering logic</li>
        <li>Implement camera movement (WASD / mouse)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>As a group, we were able to achieve milestone 1 and connect the client and server with one another. To do this, the separate branches for gameplay, networking, and graphics were merged one by one into our development branch. When the graphics branch was merged, we had to go through and fix any merge conflicts, as well as a few issues that arose during the merge.</li>
        <li>I was able to refactor some of the client code, but did the work on an older version of the development branch, so I needed to merge it into my feature branch to stay up-to-date. However, this requires some additional refactoring to account for all of the changes and additions to the development branch.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>After getting milestone 1 up and running on a lab machine, I found that I was unable to run it on my local machine (macbook) without the program crashing in one way or the other. I realized that it was an issue with the build in CLang compiler for Apple machines, and found a workaround.</li>
        <li>Because the refactoring is being delayed due to the merge, I was unable to implement camera movement, but did research on methods and potential organization.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I aim to finish the camera interaction next week. This will be a critical part of the game to get first-person interaction working, and we will be able to build off of it for the final product.</li>
        <li>I also aim to finish the refactoring. While the render loop works as currently implemented, I want to refactor and make the code easily extendible so that any future changes that we make will be easy to apply and will not have to completely break the existing code.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
      <p>This week I learned about certain boost libraries for networking, as well as some more CMake for project building.</p>
    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
      <p>My individual morale is very pleased with achieving milestone 1 this past week, but I am also a bit apprehensive since I have heard a lot about how game animation is particularly difficult. Hopefully, we will be able to set a solid groundwork so that we can implement animation and other graphics aspects of the game.</p>
