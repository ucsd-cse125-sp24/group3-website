  <h1> Edward's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Achieve milestone 1: connect the client, server, and graphics</li>
    <li>Refactor server main loop to have tick structure like in slides</li>
    <li>Change server code to start game in lobby phase, and transition to game phase when enough players connect</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All the above goals were able to be accomplished! Currently, multiple different client machines can connect to a
      server machine and be able to move a cube around. Additionally, the server main loop has the appropriate structure
      of: getting all client events, updating the game state, sending all clients the new game state, and waiting until
      the tick ends. Also, code is in place such that if one client connects but not enough clients have joined, the
      client currently just sees an empty screen. The moment enough clients connect, things appear. All my PRs were able
      to be reviewed and merged into the central dev branch</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>From my end, everything went mostly how I expected it to. We ended up getting the first milestone achieved and I
      also improved / enhanced networking features.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Code review GameState code & help plan out next features</li>
    <li>Start looking into audio</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The main learnings came from digging into some boost networking details. Specifically, there was some concern
      whether a function we were calling truly lasted the specified time, or exited early. After doing some digging
      online, I was able to confirm that it in fact does not exit early based on how we were using it. I expect learning
      stuff like this, especially as the project progresses into more advanced stages.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>My individual morale is pretty high. I’ve been pretty happy with the code I’ve gotten to work on and the
      concepts I’ve learned. It’s honestly pretty fun seeing everything connect together like in milestone 1.</li>
  </ul>
