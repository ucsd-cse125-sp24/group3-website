    <h3>Overall Status</h3>
    This week our team was able to merge all three teams, gameplay, network, and graphics into a single development
    branch. This allowed testing of network connections between the client and the server, where the client can send
    move event packets and the server can compute necessary computations based on these events. This testing can be seen
    in the image below. Now, that the network team is wrapping up with their work, they are planning to help out with other components that
    need more work in our game. The graphics team would continue to work with UI and modeling with our artist. Lastly, the gameplay team is
    trying to finalize gamestate class so that it offers an optimized transaction amongst the clients and the server, and will move onto
    more gameplay mechanics of our game.

    <h3>Group Morale</h3>
    As our team is merging majority of what we have built until now, we are seeing progress, and we are optimistic about
    this. Although we are meeting minor issues, not being able to complete all the goals that we have set, we are
    setting new goals and solving them.
