  <h1> Tyler's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>My concrete goals for the week were to help graphics and game systems get all of our branches merged in, and to
      implement the logic to handle connection drops and reconnects</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I was able to mostly accomplish both of my goals. We successfully got all of our branches merged together fairly
      quickly, although there are still some graphics refactors that have yet to be merged in. I also mostly finished
      the connection drop logic. It is fully implemented on the server side that if a client drops connection and tries
      to reconnect, the server will allow them to reconnect and reassign them to the same player slot that they had
      before. I just need to do work on the client side now so that if the connection drops then the client tries to
      automatically reconnect, because right now the client would have to completely restart the game.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The week went about as I had planned, but there were some things I wanted to get done that I wasn’t able to. I
      knew that I would have less time to work this week because I knew I was going to be out of town for the weekend,
      so that was expected. I plan to work a little extra next week to try and get everything done.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Currently the networking infrastructure is fairly solid for now, unless we decide to optimize it later on, so at
      our Tuesday meeting we are planning to discuss how to redivide tasks to meet our MVP milestone.</li>
    <li>In addition, before I expand out there are a couple of small networking things I need to touch up on
      <ul>
        <li>make the client automatically try to reconnect if connection drops</li>
        <li>make the client not crash if you launch it without a server to connect to</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I didn’t learn anything too huge, but I did learn a bunch of small things about boost and c++.</li>
    <li>Specifically, I fell down a rabbit hole trying to learn how boost::multi_index_container works, because I wanted
      on the server side to store Sessions in a HashMap that was indexable by both the id of the player and the player’s
      IP address, because there are different parts of the code where you would want to use one of those values and not
      the other to index into the sessions. It was probably overkill, but it was cool to learn and didn’t take that much
      time.</li>
    <li>Also I used the std::weak_ptr class for the first time to keep track of which sessions were still valid, which
      was cool because I had always wondered when you would actually use that kind of smart pointer.</li>
    <li>I also learned more about the game system and graphics system teams’ progress and setup because I helped them
      integrate the networking code into their branches.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Overall I have high morale still. I was a little worried this week because I felt like we weren’t making as much
      progress as I expected, and there were some goals this week that we didn’t meet, but we still met our most
      important goal of merging together all of our separate branches so once I realized that was a success I felt
      better. I think as long as we replan out how we are dividing tasks on Tuesday we will be in a very good position.
    </li>
  </ul>
