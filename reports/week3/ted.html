  <h1> Ted's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Refactor gamestate to better optimize for both the server-side and client-side</li>
    <li>Eventmanager to handle different events and allow the server to handle different events</li>
    <li>Player movement and hard coded map</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Gil and I were able to discuss different versions of the optimized gamestate, and separated into two classes
      (ServerGamestate, SharedGamestate).</li>
    <li>General event manager class was handled by the network team, so I mainly worked on how to incorporate this into
      the servergamestate, so that the logic of how to handle the event could happen in this class.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Since the gamestate class needed to be refactored for better networking communications, we spent a lot of time
      making this happen.</li>
    <li>To implement player movement and maps, it seems like having milestone 1 completed would be necessary, so we
      could not further make progress on this part.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Further implement different events (complex movement, collision) that may happen between the server and the
      clients</li>
    <li>Finish refactoring the gamestate so that it can be used in all other parts of the project</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learned that OOP in game development can be very difficult due to the number of classes and inheritance that
      it creates.</li>
    <li>Learned that plans can change very quickly depending on what is needed for the team and our milestone</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As the project gets larger, it seems difficult to understand every part of the other codebase. Though this is
      concerning, I want to just focus on what I am doing and see how it turns out when everything comes together.</li>
  </ul>
