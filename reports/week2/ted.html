  <h1> Ted's Week 3 Individual Report </h1>

  <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>My goal was to complete the gamestate skeleton with Gil this week. This includes conceptualizing various classes
      (Object, Player, etc.) that are necessary components of the game, implementing these classes, and testing some
      interactions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I was able to accomplish creating a UML diagram of classes that we need and created basic versions of these
      classes. Also, I focused on the collider classes and the collision detection since this would be a crucial
      component of our game.</li>
    <li>In addition to my goals, I started to work on our website as a side project.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I think that we spent the week mostly as planned but deciding some details and testing different approaches like
      whether to proceed with Object-Oriented Programming or Entity Component System cost us some time to fully complete
      the skeleton.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      My specific goals for next week include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Player movement and enemy AI setup: With objects and collider classes in place, we would now need the
          different objects to move in the gamestate. </li>
        <li>Hard-coded structure of the map: The small map would help testing in early stages.</li>
        <li>EventManager to manage incoming events: After meeting the goals above, we would need the event manager to
          control the movements of players and alterations of the gamestate, depending on which events that the client
          sends.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>These components would set up the basic structure of the game.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I learned that making a game engine from scratch is much more complex than I had originally thought about. Every
      detail of implementing graphics, network, and etc. all have to come from scratch and we have to manually connect
      all the pieces. In a well-known game engine like unity, all these are done behind the scenes. This may be
      difficult, but I learned that a custom game engine gives more freedom in terms of how you want the game components
      to interact, which would be helpful for designing our game.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Looking at all the hard work everyone is putting in, I believe that our team can create a great game. Really
      enjoying the process with everyone.</li>
  </ul>
