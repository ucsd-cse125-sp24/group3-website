    <h1> Coco's Week 2 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
      My concrete goals for the week were to:
      <ul>
        <li>Get inspirations from Greek mythology
        <li>Design 4 characters based on elements extracted from gods
        <li>Decide color tone
        <li>Basic design of the maze
      </ul>
    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide the tone/background of the game</li>
        <li>2D sketch & design of  4 characters - Water (Poseidon)</li>
        <li>Power/Fire (Prometheus)</li>
        <li>Lighting (Zeus)</li>
        <li>Underworld power(Hades)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
      <p>
        I was kinda stuck because we didn't really decide the backgrounds of the characters or what story we wanted to tell. It's hard to brainstorm characters without any backgrounds, and I spent a lot of time thinking if we want the iconic “western” characters or “eastern” characters. But after we determined a general background, the brainstorm went smoothly.
      </p>
    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Finalize the characters after discussion with everyone else</li>
        <li>Sketch of the maze</li>
        <li>Brainstorm about elements in the maze</li>
        <li>Start modeling the characters and finish at least 2</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I learnt about modeling techniques - how to add skeleton to the characters;</li>
        <li>I learnt about nomad - which makes it easier to carve/sculpt; could be an alternative tool for modeling.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
      <p>Everyone in the group is doing well and I am stressed about whether my design will make everyone satisfied</p>
