        <h1> Week 2 Report </h1>
        <h2>Group Report</h2>

        <h3>Overall Status</h3>
            We have completed our setup phase and are diving into the implementation of each of our components. Graphics has set up the required libraries and is working through debugging rendering needed for the client-server merge. Networking has set up Boost to use the asio library, implemented working communication with packets between client and server, and created a lobby discovery feature. The Gameplay/Physics team has been working on the initial GameState representation, collision physics, and a GameState debugger. The Design/Art team focused on creating sketches for the characters of the game.
        <h3>Group Morale</h3>
            Overall, group morale is pretty high and optimistic. Although a few of us are anxious or stressed about our individual progress, we're excited for what's to come and we're confident that we'll be able to power through our challenges together.
