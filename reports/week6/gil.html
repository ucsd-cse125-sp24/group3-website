    <h1>Gil's Week 6 Individual Report</h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <p>From my previous report, my weekly goals were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Gameplay
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Work with Ted to optimize the collision detection algorithm
                        from the <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> implementation we're
                        currently using. Some thoughts on how to do this:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                As the Professor mentioned in our Tuesday meeting
                                last week, we can use the <code>GridCell</code>
                                abstraction to help with this. What I was thinking
                                was maintaining a <code>GridCell</code> position to
                                <code>vector&lt;Object *&gt;</code> hashmap so that,
                                given a movable object, we can determine from its
                                position the <code>GridCell</code> that it's in and
                                then from that get a list of objects that are also
                                in that <code>GridCell</code>. (We'll likely need to
                                check 9 <code>GridCell</code>s around the object's
                                future position, i.e., the <code>GridCell</code> it's
                                in and all adjacent <code>GridCell</code>s, but this
                                will still only grow linearly as opposed to
                                quadratically)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We may also be able to keep track of which objects
                                are moving and only iterate over these (e.g., adding
                                a <code>vector&lt;Object *&gt; movingObjects</code>
                                field to the <code>ServerGameState</code>)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add trap support to the <code>ServerGameState</code> and
                        <code>SharedGameState</code>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We can leverage the <code>GridCell</code> abstraction
                                here - though some traps may be part of the
                                environment (read in the maze environment file), some
                                may also be dynamically placed during the game by the
                                Dungeon Master. We can place traps to cover an entire
                                <code>GridCell</code> (or at least spawn inside of
                                the <code>GridCell</code>, and each trap may have its
                                own offset as to what part of the 
                                <code>GridCell</code> it will cover)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add the Dungeon Master player type to the 
                        <code>ServerGameState</code> and <code>SharedGameState</code>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Some thoughts regarding the Dungeon Master:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                    This player doesn't need a player model and so
                                    doesn't need to be rendered; it can be
                                    implemented with just a camera position somewhere
                                    above the maze such that they can see the entire
                                    maze.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The Dungeon Master will likely need to be
                                        able to move the camera to look around the
                                        maze and zoom in / out (this can be
                                        implemented like RTS overhead view camera
                                        movement).
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                This means the ceiling of the maze
                                                shouldn't be rendered for the
                                                Dungeon Master.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The Dungeon Master will need to be able to
                                        place traps. We can again leverage the
                                        <code>GridCell</code> representation here
                                        so that when placing a trap, a grid overlay
                                        shows up on the maze of where the trap may
                                        be placed; alternatively, when placing a
                                        trap, the Dungeon Master can place it 
                                        discretely on <code>GridCell</code> positions
                                        (i.e., when moving the trap-to-be-placed
                                        around, it doesn't move continuously, but
                                        rather "snaps" to the <code>GridCell</code>
                                        being pointed at)
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Debugger (lower priority)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Update the Debugger to the current state of the 
                        <code>ServerGameState</code> and 
                        <code>SharedGameState</code>.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                This isn't a small task - ideally, the debugger
                                should allow the user to print / modify all
                                <code>ServerGameState</code> properties.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Another potential aspect of the debugger would be to
                                allow the user to simulate receiving player input
                                events in the debugger (the debugger maintains its
                                own event queue)
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Music (low priority)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Come up with some musical ideas / leitmotifs for different
                        points in the game. As the game is set in a sort of
                        Mythological Greece, it may make sense to create leitmotifs
                        for different Greek gods that may appear in the game as well
                        as for the heroes that the players play as.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Come up with musical ideas / themes / leitmotifs for: main
                        menu theme, 3 players victory theme, Dungeon Master victory
                        theme, and 3 stages of escaping the maze (green / yellow
                        / red depending on how much time is left). (For certain
                        hero / DM abilities, it may make sense to play a short
                        leitmotif (e.g., for power ups or special abilities))
                    </p>
