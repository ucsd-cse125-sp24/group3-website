    <h1> Ted's Week 8 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Add more enemies and a combat system within the maze. This would require a new system if we wanted melee combat (wands that cast spells are already implemented). Since Tyler already added a simple slime, other possible enemies that can be implemented are minotaur or snakes, based on our greek theming.
                </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Possibly add short invincibility time after being attacked for smoother combat</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>I wanted to improve our item hotbar / health bar UI, so I drew some pixelated PNGs, which upgraded our UI.</p></li>
        <li><p>Created a spawner system to regulate the number and types of enemies in the maze.</p></li>
        <li><p>Created two more new enemies (python, minotaur) and enemy drops to incentivize combat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Created 3 melee weapons (dagger, sword, hammer).</p></li>
        <li><p>Instead of invincibility time, added knockback when damaged by weapons or collisions with enemies.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add lightning attack for our DM, Zeus.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add all sound effects for what has been added as weapons/enemies.</p></li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>After finishing the midterm, I was able to add all the features that I had planned.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Further update item hotbar so different characters / DM can have their individual hotbar.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add sound effects for all the items.</p></li>
        <li><p>Polish bugs and balance the game through playtesting.</p></li>
    </ul>
    



    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I learned a lot about what the games do to make the combat system feel natural. The invincibility time, attack knockback, collision knockback, enemy attack features, and etc. Definitely more appreciation towards all games.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Since we are finalizing and polishing our game, I really would like to make our game really smooth to play!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
