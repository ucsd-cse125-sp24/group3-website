      Excellent news: our MVP is officially done!!!!! Our group had a little playtesting session on Thursday and it went very well. Everyone had a lot of fun with the current game we have!

      Look to the final game milestone above for what we are trying to finish up, but so far we've made a lot of great progress with lots of new sounds, traps, and weapons / items. The maze itself is looking spectacular and the torches add a very cool effect. We also have made lots of UI touchups and the animations are looking really great!

    <p>
      It looks like most of us are pretty happy with the current status of the game, but eager to continue finalizing / polishing various parts.
