    <h1> Ted's Week 7 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>To add more items within the game (keys that can open doors, other consumables for players, and weapons for combat)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Implement different enemies (possibly ai for them)</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I mainly kept working with items and the GUI. Specifically, I added another unknown potion so we have an orange potion (nausea and invincibility potion) that exactly looks the same. I also added item description / potion duration onto the GUI, and scaled the hotbar so it is easier to see.  Lastly, I made the potions stackable and made the player lose all effects when killed.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I have a midterm tomorrow with other projects going on, so I had less time to work on the game this week. Hopefully, I can work on the game more throughout the upcoming week.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Add more enemies and a combat system within the maze. This would require a new system if we wanted melee combat (wands that cast spells are already implemented). Since Tyler already added a simple slime, other possible enemies that can be implemented are minotaur or snakes, based on our greek theming.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Possibly add short invincibility time after being attacked for smoother combat</p>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I didnâ€™t learn anything new this week because I worked on improving the item/inventory system we setup.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I cannot really believe that it is already week 8. Only have 2.5 more weeks to work on the game! </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
