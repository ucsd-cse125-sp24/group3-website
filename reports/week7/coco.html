    <h1> Coco's Week 7 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Have the some of the textures done</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finalizing all the animation and make smooth transitions</p>
        </li>
        <li>Finish some of the weapons/potions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I worked with David to get the animation working. There’s something wrong with the way I made the skeleton, and I am not sure what I did, but it worked finally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Textures for the walls, model for the arrow shooter, and arrows</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>It’s not that I did fewer but because the progress check time is moved forward lol</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>I need to think about if I should 3d model things like lava or have them as part of the texture, and for texture to look good I need to do experiments which takes time</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Again, other projects are gonna due soon too:(</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>finish modeling the items (keys, potions, torches..)</p>
        </li>
