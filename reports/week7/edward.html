    <h1>Edward's Week 7 Individual Report</h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>

    <p>
        My main focus was getting the almighty Dungeon Master (DM) initially set up. This entailed having a top-down view of the maze, ability to zoom in/out, WASD movement, having one player be initialized to the DM on connection, and the ability to place traps around the maze (along with all other changes necessary to realize having a Dungeon Master). 
    </p>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>

    <p>
        As of around 2:20 PM on 5/15, I have been able to accomplish everything except the DM being able to place traps around the maze. It is possible that by the time this report is being read, I have already finished this feature but forgot to update my report / didn’t have time to update it. Hopefully it is the latter.
    </p>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>

    <p>
        This week didn’t go differently than how I envisioned it. Just the normal software development cycle of pull & push to my branch with new features. 
    </p>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for next week?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                If I haven’t finished trap placement for the Dungeon Master, then adding trap placement for the DM

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Implement Directional Audio, or sounds effects that respect the 3D space (if the sound if further away from the player, it should reflect that instead of sounding the same to all players)

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Adding more powers for the DM (like throwing a thunderbolt)

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>

    <p>
        I had to mess around with a little OpenGL and glm to get the Dungeon Master view appropriately set up. However, thanks to the excellent camera infrastructure code written by Anthony and David, it was pretty straightforward to pick up. Other than that, just general learning of other parts of the codebase I hadn’t really touched to integrate the features I am coding.
    </p>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall
        group morale)?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Individual morale is very high since I can tell we are really close to having a playable MVP. Once the DM has some powers, an MVP level DM should be done. Other aspects of the game are looking fantastic.
