    <h1> Edward's Week 7 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Finish trap placement and various other additions to the DM</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Get some directional audio working</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Thankfully I was able to hit both of the above. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the Dungeon Master I was able to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>add floor and wall highlighting when wanting to place a trap (the calculation for wall highlight needs to be re-worked a little)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Set a trap expiration timer on traps placed by the DM</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add a trap selection hotbar for the DM</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cap the number of traps the DM can have placed at any given time</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Have a cooldown for each placed trap so the DM can’t spam trap placements</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For Directional Audio I was able to write some code to get an audio that would play louder as I approach it in the 3D world and get quieter as I move away. The only downside is that this audio must be mono-channel to be spatialized, but I’m sure it’ll be ok for our needs.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Thankfully the week went about as I planned. At first I was worried I might get stuck with some insane bug for whatever reason, but I’m glad that didn’t happen.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Polish the Dungeon Master:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Fix wall highlight</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add trap placement for all other traps now + checks to make sure you can even place it (i.e. some traps only go on walls, others only on the floor) (right now I have everything working for one trap, but everything is in place such that adding new traps is very straightforward)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Help out with directional audio server events to client</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Miscellaneous:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Optimize sending mouse xpos and ypos events when hovering (right now if you want to place a trap, mouse movement floods server with packets)</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I learned about SFML’s support for 3D audio, which I expected to learn. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I was able to check off a lot of features we needed, so I am pretty happy. My morale is looking and feeling pretty good.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
