    <h1> Anthony's Week 5 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix up texture loading and rendering.</li>
        <li>Debug why the object loading is failing to compile on Windows GitHub actions and verify that it works on lab computers. </li>
        <li>Work with Coco and optimize the number of vertices to get the Player models loaded.</li>
        <li>Start working on animating the movement of the player models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I was able to get lighting materials loaded from the models and integrated into our shaders. 
            Additionally, I was able to render texture maps and we have a rocky Warren Bear.</li>
        <li>I worked with Coco to get the player models she made to load into the game.
            It turned out that the issue wasn’t that the models had too many vertices. 
            Instead, the models that were being exported from her modeling program were OBJ files that were formatted slightly differently than what the ASSIMP model loading library was expecting. 
            She found a compatibility export setting and we were able to load all the models (even the 700k vertex version) totally fine.
        </li>
        <li>I messed around with some simple light sources and was able to get some specular lighting effects on our models.</li>
        <li>I was able to debug the Windows GitHub action issues and also tested all the model loading and textures on the lab computers</li>
        <li>This wasn’t in my scope of work for this week, but I worked with Tyler to get two players to be able to see each other’s models move around in the game.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I expected to spend a lot more time debugging why the player models weren’t loading but thankfully it was a straightforward fix once we sat down and looked at it.</li>
        <li>Spent a lot more time on lighting materials and textures and realized there was a lot I didn’t fully understand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Set up light sources for the maze. My plan is to add torches along the walls (hopefully with some flickering effect)</li>
        <li>Load textures for the player models and the floors/walls (right now the only textured model is the bear)</li>
        <li>Make player models rotate when the user moves their mouse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Textures and lighting are more complicated than I thought. But I’m learning a lot about the lighting models that are used to approximate real world lighting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My morale is feeling a lot better now that we’ve crossed our mini-milestone 2. I’m reassured that we’re making good progress now that we have a game where you can walk\
            around a maze, look at other players, and collide with the environment. With that said, I’m still a bit apprehensive since we\
            still have a lot to do with making the game look nice (textures/lighting), animation and \
            actual gameplay elements (traps, dungeon master)
        </li>
    </ul>
