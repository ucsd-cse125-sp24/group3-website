    <h1> Edward's Week 5 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Get some kind of audio playing</li>
        <li>Finalize Enemy, Player, and Creature classes implementation</li>
        <li>Sync up with Ted, Gil, and Tyler to discuss continued development on the game state & playing
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We have sounds in our game! I was able to set up SFML using CMake and use the necessary function calls to load and play music and sound. 
        </li>
        <li>I was also able to work with Ted to test out multiple players joining a game session and seeing each other
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Initially I tried to use SDL, but it got kind of complicated so I decided to switch gears and try SFML. Thankfully, SFML was a lot easier to set up. If only I started with SFMLðŸ˜¢. I think the general consensus is SDL might be a little more powerful than SFML, but the general consensus is also that SFML is a lot easier to hit the ground running. For the game we are building, SFML should be more than enough.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Look into setting up a Dunegon Master </li>
        <li>Setting up game traps</li>
        <li>Improving collision detection (and possibly adding sounds on collision)</li>
        <li>Possibly some other tasks (the current tasks listed could change as well). It is still tentative since we just wrapped up a mini-milestone and need to discuss </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned how to set up SFML using CMake, the functions to load & play sounds & music, and how to clean up all Sounds & Music objects created. I expected to learn this since I had not used this library before and needed to understand what to call to get music and sounds playing.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My morale is pretty high! Having sounds in a game is crucial so now that it is in our game I am pretty happy. I also know my group mates have been working really hard to get the environment, camera, models, and movements working seamlessly and Iâ€™ve been able to test out what they have done so far and it is looking great.
        </li>
    </ul>
