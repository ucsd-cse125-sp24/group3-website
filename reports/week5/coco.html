    <h1> Coco's Week 5 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Texture of the maze</li>
        <li>Set up skeletons for all the characters</li>
        <li>Test the models to make sure they can be imported in and displayed correctly!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I worked with Anthony to get the player models loaded into the game. It seems that the models exported out on my end had 6 columns per row while the library reads files with 3 columns per row. I found out there’s an export option- “export colors of the vertices” so the extra 3 columns are rgb which is interesting. But thankfully Anthony and I get the models loaded at last.
        </li>
        <li>Half of the skeleton- I finished the initial version of one character but it looks a bit weird so I am still refining. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I worked mostly on refining the details of the characters and solving the problems with wiring, and it takes a while, longer than I expected (the problems come out when animating and obviously it wasn’t a done-done before)
        </li>
        <li>
            After reducing the number of vertices I lost the texture info and I need to reapply the textures. To make the game run smoother and choosing less vertices meaning that the textures look more “stylish”, I thought a lot about different ways to do the textures and make the characters look “stylish” but “real”
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I will hopefully get the skeletons set up later this week Friday/Saturday then I will work with David to test them out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish some of the weapons
        </li>
        <li>
            Have the textures of the maze done!
        </li>
        <li>Hopefully start on modeling the items (keys, potions, torches..)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore different art styles of textures and ways to refine the model for the skeleton; different ways to build the skeleton.</li>
        <li>Ways to export the files and how the file formats are different.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone is doing great!!! I have some standards about modeling and I am a bit of a perfectionist..maybe a bit binary too. I know I could make the models a bit cooler but due to the time constraints I have to move on to other pasts. Hopefully by the end of quarter when everything’s done I could have a bit more time. 
        </li>
    </ul>
