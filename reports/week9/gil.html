    <h1>Gil's Week 9 Individual Report</h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>

    <p>From last week's report, my goals were:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Gameplay
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Integrate the lobby system into our <code>dev</code> branch
                        (hopefully tomorrow, Tuesday May 27th, 2024) and fix any
                        remaining issues.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Add GUI HUD touchups (the current match phase instructions
                        for players aren't conveyed all too well with the current
                        GUI). I have discussed this with Tyler and we think a good
                        approach would be to show instructions on the player's screen
                        for a few seconds at the start of each 
                        <code>MatchPhase</code>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Help where I can - there are some bugs we encountered in
                        playtesting or otherwise and a list of them is growing in our
                        GitHub issues, so if I finish both of the previous goals I
                        will try to clear these as much as possible.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Music
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Compose the tracks / sound effects listed in the above
                        music section.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>

    <p>
        My gameplay goals somewhat changed this week from what I wrote in my previous
        report - in our Wednesday meeting, we assigned remaining tasks and I chose to
        implement the mirror item (Ted was and is working on improving the GUI, and 
        he's doing a wonderful job! The current GUI looks phenomenal!).
    </p>

    <p>
        I worked with Tyler on Tuesday to integrate the lobby system I had
        implemented into <code>dev</code>. This was a bit painful as we discovered a
        few crazy bugs (I had assumed that <code>boost::optional::get()</code>
        would throw an exception if the optional did not have a value like
        <code>std::optional</code> would which caused some issues, and we discovered
        some potential race conditions which we tentatively solved by adding a
        delay). Specifically, the race condition issue had to do with the server
        choosing a DM right before the game started (sending a
        <code>ServerAssignEID</code> packet to the client whose player has been
        chosen as the DM). We tentatively fixed this by adding a delay between
        sending this packet and the server starting the game (hopefully this bug
        will be more naturally fixed by the start game animations added by Tyler
        which act as cutscenes that play after the players click "Start Game" and
        before the game actually begins).
    </p>

    <p>
        I also implemented the mirror item - this is the player's countermeasure
        against the Dungeon Master's all-powerful lightning bolts. The idea is simple
        (and rooted in well-understood physics): the player picks up a small handheld
        mirror, caching it in their inventory for whenever they need protection from
        a well-aimed burst of static electricity. When the Dungeon Master throws down
        a lightning bolt at the direction of our player, there is a short delay where
        the player is notified of the lightning bolt (the target <code>GridCell</code>
        is covered with a yellow square, though this might later be changed to some
        particle effects) and, with quick enough reflexes, can pull out their mirror
        and hold it above their head. When the lightning bolt comes down and hits the
        mirror, it reflects back to the Dungeon Master, paralyzing them for a few
        seconds. The player's mirror breaks in the process, but at least the player
        has managed to avoid being roasted.
    </p>

    <p>
        The logic for this item is implemented (though the relevant animations are
        not). It will be interesting to see how this affects our playtests once the
        mirror item branch is integrated into <code>dev</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some screenshots for when the player successfully uses a mirror to
        reflect a lightning bolt:

    </figure>

    <h3>Music</h3>

    <p>
        This week I also made significant progress regarding the music themes needed
        for our game - I have finished improving the Maze Exploration theme for the
        Players from last week (fixed the instrumentation issue), wrote a Maze
        Exploration theme for the Dungeon Master, wrote a victory theme for the
        Players, and finished (though there might be some need for polish) the
        Relay Race theme for the Players (which interestingly came out almost exactly
        5 minutes long which is the current length of the <code>RelayRace</code>
        match phase!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's the current status:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Menu theme
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
               Start Game Theme (Players) - <code>Done</code> 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Start Game Theme (Dungeon Master) - <code>Done</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Maze Exploration Theme (Players) - <code>Done</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Maze Exploration Theme (Dungeon Master) - <code>Done</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Relay Race Theme (Players) - <code>Done (might need some polish)</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Relay Race Theme (Dungeon Master)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Victory Theme (Players) - <code>Done</code>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Victory Theme (Dungeon Master)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Defeat Theme (Players)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Defeat Theme (Dungeon Master)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sound effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Orb pickup
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Orb drop
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This means that there are only two fairly large themes to compose (the
        Menu theme and the Dungeon Master's Relay Race theme); the rest are fairly
        short (the victory / defeat themes and the Orb sound effects).
    </p>

    <p>
        I will now go over my progress since last week in more detail:
    </p>

    <h4>Maze Exploration Theme (Players)</h4>

    <p>
        This is the theme I wrote last week which sounded a bit too "sugary"
        originally due to the piano + celeste playing the melody and the use of the
        glockenspiel in the short dominant chord near the start of the theme (at the
        end of the first phrase):
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/Wrath of Zeus - Maze Exploration (Players) Theme.mp3" controls></audio>

    <p>
        I tried switched the instrumentation to be more woodwind heavy to replace the
        piano; this worked to some degree (I also boosted the brass sections which
        gave more of a "gust of wind" effect)
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/Wrath of Zeus - Maze Exploration (Players) Theme v2.mp3" controls></audio>

    <p>
        Then I saw that the string VSTs I was using weren't the new-and-improved VSTs
        that came with Musescore 4 - once I upgraded to the new versions, it made
        sense to give the melody to the violins. Adding some counterpoint here and
        there, we arrive at the current version of this theme:
    </p>

    <p>
        The "tension" in the music is generated by the constant 8th notes played by
        the cellos and the bassoons, as well as the off-beat notes played by the
        contrabasses, tuba, and timpani (a combination I'm not sure would work with
        a real orchestra but which seems to work fine here).
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/Wrath of Zeus - Maze Exploration Theme (Players) v4.mp3" controls></audio>

    <h4>Maze Exploration Theme (Dungeon Master)</h4>

    <p>
        This might be the theme I'm so far most proud of writing - I think it's
        (hopefully) harmonically interesting (as it was interesting to write). The 
        main melody is a variation of the Wrath leitmotif. I first sketched out the 
        score on the piano and then arranged what I wrote for orchestra. Here is my 
        original score sketch for piano:
    </p>

        <picture>
            <img src="assets/gil/dm_maze_exploration_theme_sketch.jpg" width="800px">
        </picture>
        <figcaption>A lot of crossing out (what happens when you don't work with an eraser)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        The cello plays the left hand here and the large chords (from which the top
        notes are the melody) are orchestrated into the brass and woodwind sections.
        The brass section actually plays this an octave lower as it's a bit outside
        of its range, which is why I added the woodwinds (which play at the right
        octave and so with both together you get the texture of the brass section and
        the right octave from the woodwinds).
    </p>

    <p>
        Adding the choir helped solidify the sort of "laughing" idea (even though
        this isn't based on the "laughter" motif interestingly enough) as the
        Dungeon Master cackles while throwing lightning bolts at the players.
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/Wrath of Zeus - Maze Exploration (Dungeon Master) Theme v3.mp3" controls></audio>

    <h4>Victory Theme (Players)</h4>

    <p>
        The victory theme for the players is based on the Heroic Determination
        leitmotif. Adding the bells to double part of the trumpet melody at the end
        hopefully gives an added sense of the victory euphoria. It begins almost
        slightly melancholy, in a sense making reference to the players' hardship in
        being able to claim victory against the Dungeon Master.
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/Wrath of Zeus - Victory Theme (Players).flac" controls></audio>

    <h4>Relay Race Theme (Players)</h4>

    <p>
        For this part, ideally I needed to write a ~ 5 minute piece (since the
        <code>RelayRace</code> match phase lasts at most that long due to the timer
        length). I have been composing / improvising for many years (almost as far
        back as when I started learning to play the piano almost 12 years ago), and
        as a result I have a lot of themes / improvisations / unfinished pieces that
        I've made over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the relay race, I found such a piece that I thought would work well. I
        had originally "written" it back in 2015 when I was 14 years old. Well, I say
        "written" - back then, I would connect my MX61 synthesizer keyboard to my
        laptop and, using Audacity, record and improvise an instrument's part. Then,
        I'd start it from the beginning and record another instrument's part (sort of
        like a very basic DAW). This is how I originally "wrote" this piece.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is the original piece I wrote back in 2015 (the relay race part starts
        at 2:07):
    </p>

    <audio src="assets/gil/relay_race_original_form.mp3" controls></audio>

    <p>
        As a result, the first step was to transcribe the piece from my recording of
        it. I made a draft in Musescore for this, documenting the different parts of
        the instruments. Then, I made a separate Musescore score to arrange my
        transcription to an orchestral arrangement (and I added / modified some parts
        as I saw fit).
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is the current state of the player's Relay Race theme:
    </p>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>

    <p>
        The major change this week was that I swapped the work on refining the GUI with
        implementing the mirror object.
    </p>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for next week?</h2>

    <p>
        My goals for next week are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Gameplay</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Finish integrating the mirror object into the <code>dev</code>
                        branch (hopefully I'll be done with this today).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Incorporate my music into the game (need to specify in the
                        client to play the DM music for the DM and the Players'
                        music for everyone else, and also to change music when the
                        <code>MatchPhase</code> changes from 
                        <code>MazeExploration</code> to <code>RelayRace</code>).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Music</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Finish writing the themes I specified above and polish wherever
                        necessary.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>

    <p>
        I learned a bit more regarding how to add a server-side timer (to implement
        DM paralysis and Player lightning invulnerability for the Mirror object to
        work) - I based this largely on how potions are implemented (Ted helped me
        out here as he wrote the original potion server-side code).
    </p>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>

    <p>
        Really excited for tomorrow's dry run, to see our game on the big screen as 
        well as hopefully hear the music I've composed in the auditorium as well.
        I'm looking forward to adding more polish to the game and completing the
        game soundtrack (soon available on a Spotify near you (for legal reasons,
        this is a joke))
    </p>
