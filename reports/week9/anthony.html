    <h1> Anthony's Week 9 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Fix in-game UI and render all objects back in with deferred shading.</p></li>
        <li><p>Load in textures/models that Coco makes (floors/ceilings/lava cracks/etc).</p></li>
        <li><p>Investigate shadow maps for players and walls (to prevent lights bleeding through walls).</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove textures from tops of walls so the DM doesnâ€™t see them.</p></li>
        <li><p>Help add a DM action to cut lights in a part of the maze.</p></li>
        <li><p>Help with mirror item to block lightning bolts.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>I was able to fix the deferred shading issues with the UI and add back in all the objects.</p></li>
        <li><p>I was able to load in the floor texture that Coco made.</p></li>
        <li><p>I focused on bringing back the old look of the lighting with the new deferred shading changes. When moving to deferred shading, I had previosly removed some stuff from the shaders just to get simple lighting working. Now, flickering is back and the specular lighting effects are looking how they used to.</p></li>
        <li><p>I helped out Tyler with some stuff for the cutscene.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>I was planning on working on shadow maps, but at this point I don't think it's necessary for the game. No one seems to notice the lights bleeding through the walls. Maybe if I have a burst of motivation this next week with nothing else to do, I'll go for it.</p></li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Add lighting to other objects (orb, exit, lightning, lava)</p></li>
        <li><p>DM action to turn off lights in an area</p></li>
        <li><p>Add bump/normal maps for the floor/walls</p></li>
        <li><p>Load in spike traps, arrow traps and any other models that are completed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Help out wherever I can to get the game ready for the demo!</p></li>
    </ul>
    


    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Not too much this week, just revisited some lighting concepts and editing UV maps in Blender.</p></li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        I'm feeling much better than previous weeks and really excited for the demo. I think we've made something great and it's obvious with all the passion everyone in the group shows.
    </ul>
