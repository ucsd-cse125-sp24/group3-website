    <h1> Ted's Week 9 Individual Report </h1>

    <h2>What were your concrete goals for the week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My concrete goals for week 9 were updating unique item hotbars for characters and DM, adding sound effects for all the items.</li>
        <li>Other than that, I wanted to help with polishing the game since it is getting closer to our demo day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Polish the in-game GUI a little more by adding:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Compass</li>
                <li>Background for item descriptions / recent events (e.g. orb has dropped, Player 1 picked up the orb…)</li>
                <li>Controls Guide on the side (can be toggled by “H”)</li>
                <li>Individual trap icons for DM hotbar</li>
                <li>DM Cooldown timer seen in hotbar</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add sound effects for all items usages (teleport, spells, potions)</li>
        <li>Add sound effects for item pickup / drops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have accomplished everything I wanted to over the week, but also spent a lot of time debugging bugs with my teammates because the codebase is stacking up!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Last week!! Hopefully, finish up everything we had planned and have a great demo day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned having a satisfying GUI is a very difficult task, in terms of both designing and coding. Although we have only created the GUI through displaying texts and printing pngs onto the screen, I wonder how complicating the triple A games make their GUI.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Love the game that we made. Hopefully, we can finish strong this week with the demo!</li>
    </ul>
